<h1> Presentation of the study<h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

Currently, aerial cable manufacturers are experiencing problems with cable aging. One of the approaches to better manage and remedy these phenomena is machine learning. 
However, this approach is hampered by a lack of field data. This has led to the development of a so-called reference model which has the advantage of modeling the cables in question, but which has the big disadvantage of being cumbersome in the software manipulations. To address this problem we have a more simplified model containing the characteristics of the reference model, but more simplified. However, this approach requires many manual adjustments when using the simplified model. The objective of our work was therefore to find an approach to use the simplified model without going through manual adjustments.
